# PredictFlow 

PredictFlow ‚Äì The Process-Aware, Predictive Open Source adjunct-BPMS 

(A lightweight intelligence layer that brings prediction, confidence, and awareness to any workflow engine.)

I have always felt, as a process practitioner, that most BPMS platforms fall short of their real purpose. They run workflows from task to task ‚Äî but they rarely understand them.

PredictFlow is my small effort to change that: a lightweight, open-source workflow engine that makes business processes proactive, intelligent, and quantifiable.
Instead of just executing steps, PredictFlow measures each one; calculating risk (FMEA), confidence, and even semantic similarity through embeddings, to highlight the critical path and reveal where a process may fail before it does.

The goal isn‚Äôt automation, it‚Äôs awareness: turning workflow execution into a living diagnostic that helps teams see, measure, and continuously improve the way they work.

PredictFlow is built for simplicity ‚Äî yet flexible enough to support FMEA risk scoring and NLP-based confidence metrics.
This is probably the first BPMS that looks to improve processes proactively, and does not simply run them. 
Based on my learnings as a process consultant.

In the current state, PredictFlow works as an adjunct layer to existing BPMSs such as Camunda.

It provides answers to questions, such as (but not limited too, I am evolving the layer as we prgress) :

‚ÄúWhich step is most likely to fail?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere is data confidence lowest?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhich branch is the real critical path?‚Äù
‚ÄúCan I predict future bottlenecks?‚Äù

What it adds to a BPMS : 

| Traditional BPMS (Camunda / Pega / Appian) | PredictFlow Layer                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Runs workflows (task ‚Üí task)               | Analyzes workflows (risk, confidence, embedding similarity) |
| Tracks completion & status                 | Measures reliability & predictive outcomes                  |
| Uses BPMN models                           | Works with YAML / JSON models or external API               |
| Stores process logs                        | Generates quantifiable metrics & insights                   |
| Focus: execution                           | Focus: awareness and continuous improvement                 |
